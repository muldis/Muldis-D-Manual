  2. Input_Method_Muldis_D.cin

----------

The plain-text file BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist is a Codeless Language Module
for the Mac OS X text editor BBEdit
(http://barebones.com/products/bbedit/), at least for version 9.x and
possibly earlier versions may be supported.

To use it, simply copy that file into this directory (which you might have
to create):

    ~/Library/Application\ Support/BBEdit/Language\ Modules

... and BBEdit will load it when it is next launched.

The CLM empowers BBEdit to syntax color Muldis D Plain Text code,
and to scan it for major entity (eg, routine and type) declarations so you
can easily jump around to those in your Muldis D Plain Text code files.

The CLM will automatically be applied to any text files with the filename
extension ".mdpt" but you can apply it to any file.

Be aware that BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist is only as completely defined as the
Muldis D Plain Text language itself and that is incomplete but should be done
soon.  Also, the syntax coloring is more rudimentary than the actual
grammar, and certainly can stand to be refactored for better accuracy
whenever I figure out more on how to properly write CLM's.

Over time I expect that Muldis D language modules for other text editors
will be created, as well as syntax coloring utilities for web display of
code, etc.  Meanwhile, what we have here is a reasonable start.

----------

The plain-text file Input_Method_Muldis_D.cin is an "input method rule
file" written in the "CIN" format, commonly used by free and open source
programs (such as OpenVanilla "http://openvanilla.org/" input method
framework), that you can see explained at
"http://www.yale.edu/chinesemac/pages/input_methods.html#cin", with
"http://openvanilla.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Modules/SharedData/" holding
some example CIN files.

The purpose of Input_Method_Muldis_D.cin is to make it easier for you to
type the various trans-ASCII mathematical/etc symbols that various concrete
Muldis D syntaxes let you use for various operators/etc, which don't have
their own keys on normal keyboards.  It helps remove the practical barriers
to writing code in a more visually pleasing or more readable way because
doing so is more difficult to write.

Of course, you may already have other input method tools at your
disposal that are effective for various mathematical/etc symbols, in which
case this option bundled with the Muldis D manual is redundant for you.
But for other people such as the author which hasn't found such tools, this
bundled plugin should make a big difference.

To use Input_Method_Muldis_D.cin on Mac OS X 10.5+, simply copy that file
into this directory (which you might have to create):

    ~/Library/Input\ Methods

... and the "International" pane of "System Preferences" should show
"Muldis D Symbols" as an Input Menu option after you next Log Out + Log In;
you can then use it in any application of your choice.

See "http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.5/en/8952.html"
also which might be useful, though the Yale link is better in general.

Using Input_Method_Muldis_D.cin on other operating systems should be
easy enough, but I don't have the installation details for you.  Perhaps if
anyone wants to supply me with such I could append them to this file.
