                             Muldis::D::Manual
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2010-02-xx   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D::Manual version 0.2.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-Manual-0.2.0.tar.gz.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.101.0:  Update a description to reflect
    that many s-d materials were moved from Muldis D extensions to core.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.102.0:  Update a description to reflect
    that the 2 top-level namespaces "dep", "sdp" replaced with the 1 "nlx".

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.103.0 for PTMD_STD:  Update to code
    example to abbreviate "&p_count => $p_count" to "&$>p_count".

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.103.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to the keywords list
    concerning the list-valued standard_syntax_extensions pragma was added.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.104.0:  Add a description to reflect
    that the 1 new top-level namespace "rtn" was added.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.105.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to the keywords list and
    function-search pattern concerning that the "union-type" keyword has
    been renamed to "domain-type" and the "nonscalar-type" keyword has been
    split into the 2 "tuple-type" and "relation-type".

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.107.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to the keywords list and
    the syntax coloring patterns concerning single-value literals or
    enumeration value names to rename them all so that they are now
    capitalized like type names rather than all lowercase; for examples,
    "nothing" and "half_even" were renamed to "Nothing" and "HalfEven".

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.107.0 for PTMD_STD:  Update to code
    examples to rename any "true" value literals to "True".

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.109.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to syntax coloring
    patterns to remove the special "String" value literal format, as the
    standard grammars no longer have "String"-specific value node kinds.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.110.0:  Update descriptions to reflect
    that "Int" now is the sole scalar primitive type and has no possreps.

    * (Input_Method_Muldis_D.cin)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.110.0 for PTMD_STD:  Renamed several chardef keys to
    more closely match the PTMD_STD-defined ASCII alternatives for Unicode
    symbols for functions that test set membership or sub/superset
    relationships; for example, the key for the char âˆˆ is now "imem" rather
    than "ismem".  The increased consistency resulting from this change
    should make the keys for the chars easier to remember.

    * Incremented all copyright year range-ends to 2010.

2009-11-09   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D::Manual version 0.1.1 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-Manual-0.1.1.tar.gz.

    * Updated all author references to change Darren Duncan's stated email
    address from "perl@DarrenDuncan.net" to "darren@DarrenDuncan.net".

2009-10-27   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D::Manual version 0.1.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-Manual-0.1.0.tar.gz.

    * Updated the README file to indicate that this distribution now has 2
    public Git repositories, one on GitHub.com and one on utsl.gen.nz.

    * (Makefile.PL, Manual.pm, Muldis_D_Manual_00_Compile.t)  Updated the
    distro so that normal users only need the most minimal dependencies
    reasonably possible, meaning it now only requires Perl 5.6.0+ rather
    than 5.8.1+, and it requires no modules at all that weren't bundled
    with 5.6.0+.  This seemed appropriate since the distro is
    documentation-only and doesn't have any normal code to run, just POD to
    render (on the other hand, that POD is UTF-8).  Updated the test file,
    which exists just to make generic CPAN build and testing facilities
    happy, to use "Test" rather than "Test::More" since that's all Perl
    5.6.0 bundled.  Also updated the Makefile.PL (and META.yml) to add
    "resources" urls.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.93.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to code
    examples to remove most expression-delimiting parenthesis because they
    are no longer mandatory.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.94.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to syntax coloring
    patterns that correspond to whitespace, which has increased strictness.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.95.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to syntax coloring
    patterns that correspond to code comments; now there are 2 distinct
    patterns, 1 "#" delimited for not-as-value comments, which is the
    "Comment Pattern", and 1 "`" delimited for as-value Comment literals,
    which is part of the "String Pattern".

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.95.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to the keywords list and
    function-search pattern concerning that all multi-word keywords now
    have words separated by dashes rather than whitespace or underscores.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.96.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to the keywords list
    concerning the 4-valued catalog_abstraction_level pragma was added.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.96.1 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to code
    examples to reflect param types now appearing to the right of param
    names rather than to the left, and now with a colon between the pair.

    * Updated the Changes file to copy into it (with trimming if needed)
    all the Changes file items from the Muldis-D and Muldis-Rosetta/DB
    distributions that described history of the files that were moved from
    that distribution into this Muldis-D-Manual distribution.  In all,
    Changes file items were imported from the Changes report for 24
    Muldis-D distribution releases, whose version numbers are listed here
    from newest to oldest: 0.91.0 (2009-09-21), 0.90.0, 0.88.0, 0.87.0,
    0.86.0, 0.83.0, 0.82.0, 0.80.0, 0.79.1, 0.79.0, 0.76.1, 0.76.0, 0.75.0,
    0.74.0, 0.73.0, 0.72.0, 0.68.0, 0.67.0, 0.65.0, 0.63.0, 0.43.0, 0.42.0,
    0.41.0, 0.40.0 (2008-07-08).  In all, Changes file items were imported
    from the Changes report for 3 Muldis-Rosetta/DB distribution releases,
    whose version numbers are listed here from newest to oldest: 0.8.0
    (2008-08-02), 0.7.0, 0.6.1 (2008-03-10).  Besides all of the above, a
    single additional Changes file item was imported from the "Rosetta"
    distribution version 0.720.0/0.720000 (2006-02-01).

2009-09-26   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D::Manual version 0.0.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-Manual-0.0.0.tar.gz.

    * This is the first release of the Muldis-D-Manual distribution, and
    the first release of any distribution to contain Perl 5 modules named
    Muldis::D::Manual::\w+.

    * This is the initial file manifest:

        archives/Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_lt.xul
        archives/Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_sa.xul

        util/BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist
        util/Input_Method_Muldis_D.cin
        util/README

    * The file lib/Muldis/D/Manual.pm is the main one that was newly
    created for the Muldis-D-Manual distro, and introduces the distro.

    * All of the 11 files in the archives/ and util/ folders, except the 1
    OSCON2005LightningTalk.txt, have been transferred here from the
    Muldis-D distribution with no significant changes, where they had been
    supplementary files and not part of the language spec proper; so from
    now on, the Muldis-D documentation would just contain the Muldis D spec
    proper and any supplementary material would live in Muldis-D-Manual.
    The 1 was transferred here from the Muldis-Rosetta distribution, where
    it constituted the entire archives/ folder.

2009-09-02  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.86.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.86.0.tar.gz.

    * (Input_Method_Muldis_D.cin)  Fixed fossils from v0.85.0 re '!' usage.

    * (Input_Method_Muldis_D.cin)  Removed "<>" as an alternate concrete
    syntax for "â‰ "; now only "!=" is an alternate.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  In accordance with the latest
    Perl 6 spec (an update on 2009.08.29), updated the HDMD_Perl6_STD code
    examples to reflect that you now use "/" to select a Perl 6 "Rat" in
    terms of 2 "Int", where you used to use "div" to do that.

2009-08-20  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.83.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.83.0.tar.gz.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Updates corresp to recent spec changes.

2009-07-27  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.82.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.82.0.tar.gz.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Other small updates corresp to
    recent spec changes.

2009-07-06  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.80.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.80.0.tar.gz.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist, Input_Method_Muldis_D.cin)  Various minor
    updates and fixes.

2009-06-16  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.79.1 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.79.1.tar.gz.

    * Forked the slideshow "archives/Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_sa.xul" into
    itself, which remains unchanged, and the new file
    "archives/Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul", which has been modified
    just enough to bring it into compliance with all the Muldis D spec
    changes made since release 0.43.0 (when "_sa" was frozen).  The most
    significant improvements in "_updated" is that all the concrete Muldis
    D code examples were rewritten into ones with the same semantics but
    that are actual semi-specced Muldis D code rather than pseudo-code;
    especially prominant is that the new code's size is 80-90% smaller than
    before, and in the examples comparing Muldis D to SQL, the Muldis D
    code was generally just half the size of the SQL code, so being less
    verbose than SQL rather than more.  And so, from now on,
    "Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul" will continue to be updated with
    each Muldis D release when it otherwise becomes incorrect, and so it
    should remain one of the best introduction materials to Muldis D.

2009-06-13  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.79.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.79.0.tar.gz.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Added special literal
    syntax to the "Tuple" and "Relation" node kinds, similar to what exists
    for "Maybe", so the plain barewords "d0", "d0c0", "d0c1" are now
    nonscalar GCVLs by themselves, like "nothing" or "âˆ…" are.  Note that
    this feature is in PTMD_STD alone; the Perl-STD dialects don't have it.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Various minor updates and fixes.

2009-06-04  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.76.1 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.76.1.tar.gz.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Missed a few updates in the last release.

2009-06-04  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.76.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.76.0.tar.gz.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Updates corresp to recent spec changes.

2009-05-28  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.75.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.75.0.tar.gz.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Updates corresp to recent spec changes.

2009-05-27  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.74.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.74.0.tar.gz.

    * Added new file "util/Input_Method_Muldis_D.cin" which is the first
    cut of a generic-format "input method" plugin, that can be installed
    as-is under various operating systems including Mac OS X 10.5, whose
    use should make it much easier to type the various trans-ASCII symbols
    that the Muldis D concrete syntaxes allow you to use for operators/etc.
    Of course, you might already have some other "input method" tool to use
    already that helps with mathematical/etc symbols so the one bundled
    with the Muldis D spec may be redundant; but otherwise it should help.
    To use it in Mac OS X, simply drop it in your "~/Library/Input Methods"
    and log out plus log in and enable it in the "International" System
    Preference panel.  Also updated "util/README" about this file.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Updates corresp to recent spec changes.

2009-05-19  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.73.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.73.0.tar.gz.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Updates corresp to recent spec changes.

2009-05-15  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.72.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.72.0.tar.gz.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Other minor updates.

2009-05-06  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.68.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.68.0.tar.gz.

    * Updated any references in BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist to reflect that
    the Muldis D dialects/grammar "PTMD_Tiny" was renamed to "PTMD_STD".

2009-05-04  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.67.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.67.0.tar.gz.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Updated this file to the latest grammar.

2009-04-22  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.65.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.65.0.tar.gz.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Partially rewrote this file, mainly the
    syntax coloring regexes, to be cleaner and to reflect the previous
    PTMD_Tiny change items.  Also, Name/NameChain/DeclNameChain literals
    are no longer colored at all, since in general they should be treated
    consistently as identifiers.  Also, the "value kind" barewords,
    essentially all the unqualified main type names, are no longer colored
    as language keywords, as they should be treated consistently with
    either type or routine invocation names.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Made several additions corresponding to
    anticipated PTMD_Tiny grammar that is yet to be codified in the spec.
    Rewrote the routine scanning pattern to look for
    "[inner_]?[function|updater|procedure]" rather than "[name|'name'] \s*
    => \s* Name:".  Added a couple dozen new keywords to the syntax
    colorer, including both the routine makers and a bunch of possible
    infix operators that are actually sugar over normal prefix operators.

2009-04-02  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.63.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.63.0.tar.gz.

    * Added new file "util/BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist" which is the first cut
    of a Codeless Language Module for the BBEdit text editor for Mac OS X
    that empowers BBEdit to syntax color and function scan code written in
    the PTMD_Tiny dialect of Muldis D.  Also added the support file
    "util/README" which explains the CLM further.  The new CLM is only as
    complete as the language spec itself, and mainly what it is the most
    complete about is syntax coloring Muldis D value literals.  Also
    updated the README file to refer to the "util/" and "archives/" dirs.
    While not exactly its intended use, you can get a taste of the CLM
    working by opening the PTMD_Tiny.pod file in BBEdit with the CLM
    installed and look at the various code examples in the POD file.

2008-08-02   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis Rosetta version 0.8.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-Rosetta-0.8.0.tar.gz.

    * The file archives/OSCON2008SessionProposal.txt was moved from the
    Muldis Rosetta version control / distribution to the Muldis D one.

2008-07-29  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.43.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.43.0.tar.gz.

    * Savagely chopped the Live Talk version of the Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807
    slideshow to remove all the content text, keeping just the section
    headings, a handful of bullets, and all but one of the code samples.
    There should be no doubt whatsoever now that the presenter isn't
    reading the slides; also, this result is more like the actual Takahashi
    format that the XUL software is designed for; also, it now should be
    easier to fit into the allowed time.  This was presented at OSCON on
    July 23.  Then the Stand Alone version had its end updated to format
    like the rest of the SA slideshow.  And so following this, this
    2-version 2008 July slideshow is now frozen into the archives.

    * The file archives/OSCON2008SessionProposal.txt was moved from the
    Muldis Rosetta version control / distribution to the Muldis D one.

2008-07-21  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.42.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.42.0.tar.gz.

    * Edited and trimmed the slideshow "archives/Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807.xul"
    substantially, removing about 30% of its size.  The changes were
    inspired largely by feedback from several sources on the version in
    release 0.41.0.  The cuts mainly were about removing "boring" parts
    like introductives and less interesting or common features; also many
    parts were edited to say the same thing in substantially fewer words;
    all in all, this was just fat trimming and the result shouldn't lack
    anything useful that was in the previous one.  This new version would
    barely fit in 45 minutes if read aloud, but it is in fact now intended
    as the paper for download, so people not at a live talk based on this
    can still get all the material.  There was also some reordering, and a
    bit of additions near the front to make it easier to know early what
    the talk and the project is about.

    * Forked said slideshow into a "_sa" (Stand Alone) and "_lt" (Live
    Talk) version, the former being the version for viewing on its own, or
    use as speaker's notes, and the latter for actual display during the
    talk.  The live version changes the quasi-sentences of the stand alone
    to bullet points and less text.  This was presented at PDXPug PGDay on
    July 20th.

    * Partly due to feedback gotten at the OSCON speakers' workshop on July
    21, the talk will be redone again, using a different presentation tool,
    and making the live version have very little content so it differs
    greatly from what is spoken, this all in preparation for July 23.

2008-07-15  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.41.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.41.0.tar.gz.

    * Rewrote the slideshow "archives/Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807.xul" so it has
    more appropriate content, and is a better length.  While this version
    should be complete on talking about Muldis D, it still lacks anything
    on Muldis Rosetta, which should end up about 10% of the size, except
    that there are internal todo notes on this.  And next I'll need to chop
    down the size of the new version so it can be presented in about 45
    minutes, for which I'll solicit advice.  That cut version should be in
    a near future subsequent release.

2008-07-08  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.40.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.40.0.tar.gz.

    * Added new file "archives/Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807.xul" which is the very
    rough first draft of the slideshow for the 2008 July talk "Muldis D -
    Portable Databases At Full Power".  This talk is created for giving at
    OSCON 2008, and it is also being given at several other events in 2008
    July.  Following a practice presentation on 2008 July 8th, which used
    the (first half of) this exact file (except new postscript first
    screen), it was decided to completely rewrite the slideshow with
    different content.  Meanwhile this version is now being released on
    CPAN for posterity.  The next CPAN release of Muldis D will not have
    this version, rather its replacement.  This talk is a XUL file and it
    requires Mozilla Firefox to run (or you can read its text in a text
    editor).  Also added the 2 support files "archives/takahashi.(css|js)"
    plus the file "archives/README".

    * Muldis Rosetta version 0.7.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-Rosetta-0.7.0.tar.gz.

    * Minor update to the file archives/OSCON2008SessionProposal.txt which
    reflects that the proposal was accepted; the talk will be given Jul 23.
    Also retconned the file to use current names, urls of Muldis D|Rosetta;
    the copy on the OSCON website will likewise be updated if possible.

    * Muldis DB version 0.6.1 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.6.1.tar.gz.

    * Added new file archives/OSCON2008SessionProposal.txt which is a copy
    of a proposal to give a talk on Muldis D + DB at OSCON 2008 (it can
    also be given elsewhere); this is likely the most succinct description
    yet of what the projects are and why one would want to use them.

    * Rosetta Release 0.720.0/0.720000 (SVN r1203).

    * Added new file docs/OSCON2005LightningTalk.txt, which has the
    pristine text for a lightning talk I gave, and outlined in 5 minutes
    what at-that-time Rosetta was and was to be.
