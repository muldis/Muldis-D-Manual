                             Muldis::D::Manual
                                  Changes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2015-06-xx

    * Muldis::D::Manual version 0.10.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-Manual-0.10.0.tar.gz.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D Plain Text spec version 0.200+, rewrote this file.  The new
    version is just 1/3 of the size of the old one, 3K down from 8K, and
    should perform faster too.

    * Incremented all copyright year range-ends to 2011.

2010-07-24

    * Muldis::D::Manual version 0.9.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-Manual-0.9.0.tar.gz.

    * (CD.pod)  Updated the example code, in all 3 dialects, such that all
    type and constraint declarations have been consolidated into a topology
    that much more closely resembles their most likely direct SQL database
    counterparts.  This is effectively just a code refactor as the
    structure of all actual database data/relvars didn't change at all.
    Firstly, the root database type now has the empty string as its
    declared name, as if it was effectively built-in to the depot
    scaffholding rather than being a normal user-defined type.  Secondly,
    the definition of each relvar is now effectively built-in to it.  The
    effective name of the relation type for each relvar is now lowercased
    and so identical to the name of its relvar, and the tuple type plus
    primary key that help define the relation type are now nested into the
    latter, meaning that the relation type now declares a subdepot with the
    same name as its relvar and the triple are nested beneath that
    subdepot, with the relvar having an empty-string name.  All of the
    now-nested tuple types and primary keys have been renamed to just "T"
    and "pk" respectively, and so all relation type defs now have a more
    uniform format.  Where applicable, any surrogate keys of relation types
    had also become nested under the latter, but their declared names
    didn't change.  The subset constraints were not renamed or nested,
    staying as they were.  No routines were changed at all.

    * (CD.pod, Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.135.0:  Update all code examples with
    postcircumfix op invocations to excise the [$,%,@] sigils leading the
    circumfix parts, such as "@:{...}" rather than "Relation:{...}".

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.135.0 for PTMD_STD:  Update the keywords list to
    remove all 12 Latin-letter keywords denoting sub/superset tests.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.136.0 for PTMD_STD:  Update the syntax coloring
    patterns and function-search pattern considering changes to the syntax
    of code comments and how string literals treat whitespace.

    * (CD.pod, Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul, TemporalExtras.pod)
    Corresponding to changes introduced in Muldis D spec v0.136.0 for
    PTMD_STD:  Update all code examples with not-as-value comments to add
    nested backtick delimiters, remove per-line delims from block comments.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.136.0 for PTMD_STD:  Update all code
    examples with cardinality prefix op to rename it to "#" from "r#".

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.137.0 for PTMD_STD:  Update all code
    examples with symbolic prefix ops to remove now-optional whitespace.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.137.0 for PTMD_STD:  Update the keywords list to
    consolidate/rename the keywords denoting membership-tests like "in".

2010-07-13

    * Muldis::D::Manual version 0.8.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-Manual-0.8.0.tar.gz.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Fixed an omission in the function-search
    pattern so that it now finds subdepot declarations also.

    * (TemporalExtras.pod)  Corresponding to changes introduced in Muldis D
    spec v0.131.0:  Updated the temporal types' documentation to reflect
    that the core type "Single" was renamed to "Just".

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.132.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to the function-search
    pattern and to the syntax coloring patterns for text, comment strings
    to reflect that a string may now contain the same literal char as is
    used to delimit that string, but only when backslash-escaped.

    * (CD.pod, Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.133.0:  Update all code examples with
    collection value literals/selectors to use their new terser variant
    formats, such as "@:{...}" rather than "Relation:{...}".

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.134.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to the syntax coloring
    patterns for num, blob literals to support [b,o,d,x] radix specifiers.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul, TemporalExtras.pod)
    Corresponding to changes introduced in Muldis D spec v0.134.0:  Update
    all code examples with num, blob literals to use their new [b,o,d,x]
    variant formats, or to reflect Perls' terser native literal formats.

2010-06-20

    * Muldis::D::Manual version 0.7.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-Manual-0.7.0.tar.gz.

    * (Manual.pm, README)  Updated the list of email forums focusing on
    Muldis D and its implementations, first to add a 4th list
    muldis-d-language, and second to update all 4 lists' descriptions.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Minor terminology change.

    * (TemporalExtras.pod)  Updated all system-defined routine
    documentation so that the illustrative declarations of each now just
    have the unqualified routine names, same as the real declarations
    would, rather than being fully-qualified; the level-2 heading for each
    routine description already has the latter.

    * (CD.pod)  Corresponding to changes introduced in Muldis D spec
    v0.130.0 for PTMD_STD:  Update all code examples using shorthand syntax
    for "foo=>foo" that looked like ">foo" to instead look like "=>foo".

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.130.0 for PTMD_STD:  Update the keywords list to
    remove all 6 single-Latin-letter keywords: x, d, t, r, s, v.

    * (CD.pod, TemporalExtras.pod, Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)
    Corresponding to changes introduced in Muldis D spec v0.130.0 for
    PTMD_STD:  Update all code examples or routine documentation to excise
    the "$" sigils, which are no longer used to mark data-entities.

2010-05-18

    * Muldis::D::Manual version 0.6.1 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-Manual-0.6.1.tar.gz.

    * (Manual.pm, README, Makefile.PL)  Updated any instances of
    "http://mm.DarrenDuncan.net/mailman/listinfo" so that they are fully
    lower-cased, because the mixed case version doesn't work with some web
    browsers; browsers that don't automatically convert it to lowercase get
    a "There currently are no publically-advertised mailman lists" message.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Fixed a fossil where in release 0.6.0 the
    keywords list should have included these 5 additional or renamed items
    (re MD v0.129.0) but didn't: "determinant-attrs", "dependent-attrs",
    "map-function", "is-updateable", "and-provides-its-default".

2010-05-16

    * Muldis::D::Manual version 0.6.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-Manual-0.6.0.tar.gz.

    * (CD.pod)  Fixed a design error in the example code where it assumed
    that exactly one tuple would result from some queries, when in fact
    zero tuples might result instead.

    * (CD.pod)  Fixed example code to add a try/catch block around the
    record insertion code, to gracefully deal and display a message if the
    insertion failed due to duplicate titles/etc constraint violation.

    * (TemporalExtras.pod)  Renamed the 3 "Date and Time Literals" pod
    sub-sections to add unique prefixes so that navigation links work.

    * (CD.pod)  Add 2 more copies of the example code, one for each of the
    2 Muldis D Perl-STD dialects.  But while the PTMD_STD dialect's copy of
    the example is complete, the HDMD_Perl6_STD and HDMD_Perl5_STD
    dialects' copies of the example are each missing the bodies of 13
    routines, and have just the headings/signatures for those 13; the
    HDMD_Perl6_STD and HDMD_Perl5_STD dialects' copies of the example are
    otherwise complete, having the complete definitions of 7 routines, and
    all of the type definitions, constraints, scaffolding, and data.  The
    PTMD_STD copy is, in any event, the most terse and readable, especially
    for routine definitions; the routines that are complete in the 2
    Perl-STD copies should constitute a representative subset, such that
    one should be able to infer the missing routine bodies easily enough
    through comparison with the complete PTMD_STD copy; but the other
    routines might also be made complete later if the rationale exists.

2010-05-12

    * Muldis::D::Manual version 0.5.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-Manual-0.5.0.tar.gz.

    * Added new file "lib/Muldis/D/Manual/CD.pod" which features example
    code that demonstrates a very basic CD database, which consists of a
    schema definition having relvars to store data and routines to fetch or
    update that data, and it includes some sample data.  For users that are
    better served with a complete example than a spec, this should do it.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.129.0 for PTMD_STD:  Added "compose" to keywords list.

2010-05-11

    * Muldis::D::Manual version 0.4.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-Manual-0.4.0.tar.gz.

    * Added new file "lib/Muldis/D/Manual/TemporalExtras.pod" which houses
    all the substantial material that was purged from the "Muldis D
    Temporal Extension" and related parts of the Muldis D language spec as
    of its release 0.121.0, with the intent to be moved to the Muldis D
    Manual for use as a resource when implementing non-mixin temporal types
    and non-virtual temporal operators in Muldis D in the future,
    especially if those would be by third parties as user-def materials.

2010-05-11

    * Muldis::D::Manual version 0.3.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-Manual-0.3.0.tar.gz.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.111.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to the syntax coloring
    patterns and function-search pattern concerning segmentation of long
    stringy value literals; the patterns are simplified because now even a
    segmented string still just has a single pair of quotes around the
    whole literal, rather than a pair of quotes around each segment.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.112.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to the keywords list and
    function-search pattern concerning that the "mixin-type" keyword has
    been added.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.112.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to the keywords list
    concerning the "date_time" SSE was renamed to "temporal".

    * (Input_Method_Muldis_D.cin)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.112.0 for PTMD_STD:  Renamed several chardef keys to
    match the renames of the set membership testing operators; the 4 keys
    "[|n][i|h]mem" were renamed to "[|n][in|has]", respectively.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.113.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to the syntax coloring
    patterns concerning the "RatRoundMeth" type being renamed to
    "RoundMeth", and 2 of its values being renamed, and 2 values added.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.113.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to syntax coloring
    patterns that correspond to some optional whitespace in value literals,
    which is now prohibited except as an "unspace".

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.115.0:  Update several descriptions and
    code examples to reflect the addition of the "recipe" 4th main routine
    kind, and the reduction of what a "procedure" can directly do.  Also
    purged the slides talking about "inner routines", which haven't existed
    for awhile; they were marked w rewrite-TODOs, but removal is simpler.

    * (Input_Method_Muldis_D.cin)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.115.0 for PTMD_STD:  Removed 4 chardefs that
    associated the math op chars [*+-%] with the relational ops [∩∪∖∆].

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.116.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to the syntax coloring
    patterns concerning that the "Singleton" domain-union type, and its 2
    singleton-type values "-Inf", "Inf" (and "-∞", "∞") have been added.

    * (Input_Method_Muldis_D.cin)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.116.0 for PTMD_STD:  Added chardef for "∞" character.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.117.0:  Added a note to
    reflect no one writes "lex" anymore; that namespace now just a concept.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.118.0 for PTMD_STD:  Update to code
    examples to reflect that most math op spec-syn were renamed or merged.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.120.0:  Update to code example to
    reflect use of new mixin temporal type and virtual system-service.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.121.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to the syntax coloring
    patterns and keywords list concerning that the temporal standard syntax
    extension has been completely removed from the grammar, as part of the
    purge of all non-mixin temporal types and all non-virtual temporal
    routines from the language; removed the 'temporal' keyword and the
    syntax coloring patterns for "TAI[Instant|Duration]",
    "[UTC|Float][Instant|DateTime|Date|Time", "UTCDuration".

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.122.0 and v0.124.0 for PTMD_STD:  Update
    to code example to reflect that concrete syntax for material
    references, and for routine embedding, both such as are used for
    higher-order functions, is now finalized.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Many additions to the keywords list and
    function-search pattern, some corresponding to changes in multiple past
    Muldis D spec versions, and some relating to plans of uspecced syntax.

2010-03-01

    * Muldis::D::Manual version 0.2.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-Manual-0.2.0.tar.gz.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.101.0:  Update a description to reflect
    that many s-d materials were moved from Muldis D extensions to core.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.102.0:  Update a description to reflect
    that the 2 top-level namespaces "dep", "sdp" replaced with the 1 "nlx".

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.103.0 for PTMD_STD:  Update to code
    example to abbreviate "&p_count => $p_count" to "&$>p_count".

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.103.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to the keywords list
    concerning the list-valued standard_syntax_extensions pragma was added.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.104.0:  Add a description to reflect
    that the 1 new top-level namespace "rtn" was added.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.105.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to the keywords list and
    function-search pattern concerning that the "union-type" keyword has
    been renamed to "domain-type" and the "nonscalar-type" keyword has been
    split into the 2 "tuple-type" and "relation-type".

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.107.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to the keywords list and
    the syntax coloring patterns concerning single-value literals or
    enumeration value names to rename them all so that they are now
    capitalized like type names rather than all lowercase; for examples,
    "nothing" and "half_even" were renamed to "Nothing" and "HalfEven".

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.107.0 for PTMD_STD:  Update to code
    examples to rename any "true" value literals to "True".

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.109.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to syntax coloring
    patterns to remove the special "String" value literal format, as the
    standard grammars no longer have "String"-specific value node kinds.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.110.0:  Update descriptions to reflect
    that "Int" now is the sole scalar primitive type and has no possreps.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.110.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to the keywords list
    concerning the 2-valued op_char_repertoire pragma was added.

    * (Input_Method_Muldis_D.cin)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.110.0 for PTMD_STD:  Renamed several chardef keys to
    more closely match the PTMD_STD-defined ASCII alternatives for Unicode
    symbols for functions that test set membership or sub/superset
    relationships; for example, the key for the char ∈ is now "imem" rather
    than "ismem".  The increased consistency resulting from this change
    should make the keys for the chars easier to remember.

    * Incremented all copyright year range-ends to 2010.

2009-11-09

    * Muldis::D::Manual version 0.1.1 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-Manual-0.1.1.tar.gz.

    * Updated all author references to change Darren Duncan's stated email
    address from "perl@DarrenDuncan.net" to "darren@DarrenDuncan.net".

2009-10-27

    * Muldis::D::Manual version 0.1.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-Manual-0.1.0.tar.gz.

    * Updated the README file to indicate that this distribution now has 2
    public Git repositories, one on GitHub.com and one on utsl.gen.nz.

    * (Makefile.PL, Manual.pm, Muldis_D_Manual_00_Compile.t)  Updated the
    distro so that normal users only need the most minimal dependencies
    reasonably possible, meaning it now only requires Perl 5.6.0+ rather
    than 5.8.1+, and it requires no modules at all that weren't bundled
    with 5.6.0+.  This seemed appropriate since the distro is
    documentation-only and doesn't have any normal code to run, just POD to
    render (on the other hand, that POD is UTF-8).  Updated the test file,
    which exists just to make generic CPAN build and testing facilities
    happy, to use "Test" rather than "Test::More" since that's all Perl
    5.6.0 bundled.  Also updated the Makefile.PL (and META.yml) to add
    "resources" urls.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.93.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to code
    examples to remove most expression-delimiting parenthesis because they
    are no longer mandatory.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.94.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to syntax coloring
    patterns that correspond to whitespace, which has increased strictness.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.95.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to syntax coloring
    patterns that correspond to code comments; now there are 2 distinct
    patterns, 1 "#" delimited for not-as-value comments, which is the
    "Comment Pattern", and 1 "`" delimited for as-value Comment literals,
    which is part of the "String Pattern".

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.95.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to the keywords list and
    function-search pattern concerning that all multi-word keywords now
    have words separated by dashes rather than whitespace or underscores.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Corresponding to changes introduced in
    Muldis D spec v0.96.0 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to the keywords list
    concerning the 4-valued catalog_abstraction_level pragma was added.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Corresponding to changes
    introduced in Muldis D spec v0.96.1 for PTMD_STD:  Updates to code
    examples to reflect param types now appearing to the right of param
    names rather than to the left, and now with a colon between the pair.

    * Updated the Changes file to copy into it (with trimming if needed)
    all the Changes file items from the Muldis-D and Muldis-Rosetta/DB
    distributions that described history of the files that were moved from
    that distribution into this Muldis-D-Manual distribution.  In all,
    Changes file items were imported from the Changes report for 24
    Muldis-D distribution releases, whose version numbers are listed here
    from newest to oldest: 0.91.0 (2009-09-21), 0.90.0, 0.88.0, 0.87.0,
    0.86.0, 0.83.0, 0.82.0, 0.80.0, 0.79.1, 0.79.0, 0.76.1, 0.76.0, 0.75.0,
    0.74.0, 0.73.0, 0.72.0, 0.68.0, 0.67.0, 0.65.0, 0.63.0, 0.43.0, 0.42.0,
    0.41.0, 0.40.0 (2008-07-08).  In all, Changes file items were imported
    from the Changes report for 3 Muldis-Rosetta/DB distribution releases,
    whose version numbers are listed here from newest to oldest: 0.8.0
    (2008-08-02), 0.7.0, 0.6.1 (2008-03-10).  Besides all of the above, a
    single additional Changes file item was imported from the "Rosetta"
    distribution version 0.720.0/0.720000 (2006-02-01).

2009-09-26

    * Muldis::D::Manual version 0.0.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-Manual-0.0.0.tar.gz.

    * This is the first release of the Muldis-D-Manual distribution, and
    the first release of any distribution to contain Perl 5 modules named
    Muldis::D::Manual::\w+.

    * This is the initial file manifest:

    * The file lib/Muldis/D/Manual.pm is the main one that was newly
    created for the Muldis-D-Manual distro, and introduces the distro.

    * All of the 11 files in the archives/ and util/ folders, except the 1
    OSCON2005LightningTalk.txt, have been transferred here from the
    Muldis-D distribution with no significant changes, where they had been
    supplementary files and not part of the language spec proper; so from
    now on, the Muldis-D documentation would just contain the Muldis D spec
    proper and any supplementary material would live in Muldis-D-Manual.
    The 1 was transferred here from the Muldis-Rosetta distribution, where
    it constituted the entire archives/ folder.

2009-06-16

    * Muldis::D version 0.79.1 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.79.1.tar.gz.

    * Forked the slideshow "archives/Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_sa.xul" into
    itself, which remains unchanged, and the new file
    "archives/Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul", which has been modified
    just enough to bring it into compliance with all the Muldis D spec
    changes made since release 0.43.0 (when "_sa" was frozen).  The most
    significant improvements in "_updated" is that all the concrete Muldis
    D code examples were rewritten into ones with the same semantics but
    that are actual semi-specced Muldis D code rather than pseudo-code;
    especially prominant is that the new code's size is 80-90% smaller than
    before, and in the examples comparing Muldis D to SQL, the Muldis D
    code was generally just half the size of the SQL code, so being less
    verbose than SQL rather than more.  And so, from now on,
    "Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul" will continue to be updated with
    each Muldis D release when it otherwise becomes incorrect, and so it
    should remain one of the best introduction materials to Muldis D.

2009-06-13

    * Muldis::D version 0.79.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.79.0.tar.gz.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Added special literal
    syntax to the "Tuple" and "Relation" node kinds, similar to what exists
    for "Maybe", so the plain barewords "d0", "d0c0", "d0c1" are now
    nonscalar GCVLs by themselves, like "nothing" or "∅" are.  Note that
    this feature is in PTMD_STD alone; the Perl-STD dialects don't have it.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Various minor updates and fixes.

2009-06-04

    * Muldis::D version 0.76.1 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.76.1.tar.gz.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Missed a few updates in the last release.

2009-06-04

    * Muldis::D version 0.76.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.76.0.tar.gz.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Updates corresp to recent spec changes.

2009-05-28

    * Muldis::D version 0.75.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.75.0.tar.gz.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Updates corresp to recent spec changes.

2009-05-27

    * Muldis::D version 0.74.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.74.0.tar.gz.

    * Added new file "util/Input_Method_Muldis_D.cin" which is the first
    cut of a generic-format "input method" plugin, that can be installed
    as-is under various operating systems including Mac OS X 10.5, whose
    use should make it much easier to type the various trans-ASCII symbols
    that the Muldis D concrete syntaxes allow you to use for operators/etc.
    Of course, you might already have some other "input method" tool to use
    already that helps with mathematical/etc symbols so the one bundled
    with the Muldis D spec may be redundant; but otherwise it should help.
    To use it in Mac OS X, simply drop it in your "~/Library/Input Methods"
    and log out plus log in and enable it in the "International" System
    Preference panel.  Also updated "util/README" about this file.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Updates corresp to recent spec changes.

2009-05-19

    * Muldis::D version 0.73.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.73.0.tar.gz.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Updates corresp to recent spec changes.

2009-05-15

    * Muldis::D version 0.72.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.72.0.tar.gz.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Other minor updates.

2009-05-06

    * Muldis::D version 0.68.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.68.0.tar.gz.

    * Updated any references in BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist to reflect that
    the Muldis D dialects/grammar "PTMD_Tiny" was renamed to "PTMD_STD".

2009-05-04

    * Muldis::D version 0.67.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.67.0.tar.gz.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Updated this file to the latest grammar.

2009-04-22

    * Muldis::D version 0.65.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.65.0.tar.gz.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Partially rewrote this file, mainly the
    syntax coloring regexes, to be cleaner and to reflect the previous
    PTMD_Tiny change items.  Also, Name/NameChain/DeclNameChain literals
    are no longer colored at all, since in general they should be treated
    consistently as identifiers.  Also, the "value kind" barewords,
    essentially all the unqualified main type names, are no longer colored
    as language keywords, as they should be treated consistently with
    either type or routine invocation names.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Made several additions corresponding to
    anticipated PTMD_Tiny grammar that is yet to be codified in the spec.
    Rewrote the routine scanning pattern to look for
    "[inner_]?[function|updater|procedure]" rather than "[name|'name'] \s*
    => \s* Name:".  Added a couple dozen new keywords to the syntax
    colorer, including both the routine makers and a bunch of possible
    infix operators that are actually sugar over normal prefix operators.

2009-04-02

    * Muldis::D version 0.63.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.63.0.tar.gz.

    * Added new file "util/BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist" which is the first cut
    of a Codeless Language Module for the BBEdit text editor for Mac OS X
    that empowers BBEdit to syntax color and function scan code written in
    the PTMD_Tiny dialect of Muldis D.  Also added the support file
    "util/README" which explains the CLM further.  The new CLM is only as
    complete as the language spec itself, and mainly what it is the most
    complete about is syntax coloring Muldis D value literals.  Also
    updated the README file to refer to the "util/" and "archives/" dirs.
    While not exactly its intended use, you can get a taste of the CLM
    working by opening the PTMD_Tiny.pod file in BBEdit with the CLM
    installed and look at the various code examples in the POD file.

2008-08-02

    * Muldis Rosetta version 0.8.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-Rosetta-0.8.0.tar.gz.

    * The file archives/OSCON2008SessionProposal.txt was moved from the
    Muldis Rosetta version control / distribution to the Muldis D one.

2008-07-29

    * Muldis::D version 0.43.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.43.0.tar.gz.

    * Savagely chopped the Live Talk version of the Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807
    slideshow to remove all the content text, keeping just the section
    headings, a handful of bullets, and all but one of the code samples.
    There should be no doubt whatsoever now that the presenter isn't
    reading the slides; also, this result is more like the actual Takahashi
    format that the XUL software is designed for; also, it now should be
    easier to fit into the allowed time.  This was presented at OSCON on
    July 23.  Then the Stand Alone version had its end updated to format
    like the rest of the SA slideshow.  And so following this, this
    2-version 2008 July slideshow is now frozen into the archives.

    * The file archives/OSCON2008SessionProposal.txt was moved from the
    Muldis Rosetta version control / distribution to the Muldis D one.

2008-07-21

    * Muldis::D version 0.42.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.42.0.tar.gz.

    * Edited and trimmed the slideshow "archives/Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807.xul"
    substantially, removing about 30% of its size.  The changes were
    inspired largely by feedback from several sources on the version in
    release 0.41.0.  The cuts mainly were about removing "boring" parts
    like introductives and less interesting or common features; also many
    parts were edited to say the same thing in substantially fewer words;
    all in all, this was just fat trimming and the result shouldn't lack
    anything useful that was in the previous one.  This new version would
    barely fit in 45 minutes if read aloud, but it is in fact now intended
    as the paper for download, so people not at a live talk based on this
    can still get all the material.  There was also some reordering, and a
    bit of additions near the front to make it easier to know early what
    the talk and the project is about.

    * Forked said slideshow into a "_sa" (Stand Alone) and "_lt" (Live
    Talk) version, the former being the version for viewing on its own, or
    use as speaker's notes, and the latter for actual display during the
    talk.  The live version changes the quasi-sentences of the stand alone
    to bullet points and less text.  This was presented at PDXPug PGDay on
    July 20th.

    * Partly due to feedback gotten at the OSCON speakers' workshop on July
    21, the talk will be redone again, using a different presentation tool,
    and making the live version have very little content so it differs
    greatly from what is spoken, this all in preparation for July 23.

2008-07-15

    * Muldis::D version 0.41.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.41.0.tar.gz.

    * Rewrote the slideshow "archives/Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807.xul" so it has
    more appropriate content, and is a better length.  While this version
    should be complete on talking about Muldis D, it still lacks anything
    on Muldis Rosetta, which should end up about 10% of the size, except
    that there are internal todo notes on this.  And next I'll need to chop
    down the size of the new version so it can be presented in about 45
    minutes, for which I'll solicit advice.  That cut version should be in
    a near future subsequent release.

2008-07-08

    * Muldis::D version 0.40.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.40.0.tar.gz.

    * Added new file "archives/Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807.xul" which is the very
    rough first draft of the slideshow for the 2008 July talk "Muldis D -
    Portable Databases At Full Power".  This talk is created for giving at
    OSCON 2008, and it is also being given at several other events in 2008
    July.  Following a practice presentation on 2008 July 8th, which used
    the (first half of) this exact file (except new postscript first
    screen), it was decided to completely rewrite the slideshow with
    different content.  Meanwhile this version is now being released on
    CPAN for posterity.  The next CPAN release of Muldis D will not have
    this version, rather its replacement.  This talk is a XUL file and it
    requires Mozilla Firefox to run (or you can read its text in a text
    editor).  Also added the 2 support files "archives/takahashi.(css|js)"
    plus the file "archives/README".

2008-04-12

    * Muldis Rosetta version 0.7.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-Rosetta-0.7.0.tar.gz.

    * Minor update to the file archives/OSCON2008SessionProposal.txt which
    reflects that the proposal was accepted; the talk will be given Jul 23.
    Also retconned the file to use current names, urls of Muldis D|Rosetta;
    the copy on the OSCON website will likewise be updated if possible.

2008-03-10

    * Muldis DB version 0.6.1 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.6.1.tar.gz.

    * Added new file archives/OSCON2008SessionProposal.txt which is a copy
    of a proposal to give a talk on Muldis D + DB at OSCON 2008 (it can
    also be given elsewhere); this is likely the most succinct description
    yet of what the projects are and why one would want to use them.

2006-02-01

    * Rosetta Release 0.720.0/0.720000 (SVN r1203).

    * Added new file docs/OSCON2005LightningTalk.txt, which has the
    pristine text for a lightning talk I gave, and outlined in 5 minutes
    what at-that-time Rosetta was and was to be.
